# SRI

The code analyzes sleep data to calculate the Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) and sleep midpoint. It first defines functions to calculate these metrics, handling potential missing values and extra epochs. Then, it reads sleep data from a CSV file. It processes this data using the defined functions to determine the SRI and sleep midpoint, printing the results. Finally, it visualizes the sleep data with a simple plot showing sleep patterns over time. This script provides a way to quantify sleep regularity and midpoint, which can be useful for understanding sleep patterns and their potential health implications.
